## Bounds For The Extremal Eigenvalues of the Gain Laplacian

- Here, we compare the extremal bounds obtained in our paper [[1]](#1) with the state-of-the-art bounds available in the literature. `Comparing_Extremal_Bounds.ipynb` contains all the coded bound expressions and their numerical values. 
- Additionally, we provide an analysis for our gersgorian bounds and show that these bounds can be tweaked to perform better than the existing bounds.
